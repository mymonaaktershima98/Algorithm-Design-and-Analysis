This repository contains the implementation of two fundamental searching algorithms in C++:

✅ Linear Search
✅ Binary Search  

1️. Linear Search
Linear Search is a simple method where each element of an array is checked one by one to find a target. 

How It Works:
1. Start from the first element.
2. Compare each element with the target.
3. If found, return its index.
4. If not found after checking all elements, return -1.  

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(n) 

2️. Binary Search
Binary Search finds the target in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

How It Works:
1. Check the middle element of the array.
2. If target equals middle → return index
3. If target < middle → search left half
4. If target > middle → search right half
5. Repeat until element is found or search space is empty

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(log n) 
Average Case: O(log n)
